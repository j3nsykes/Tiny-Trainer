      # Step 2: Set up Node.js (use Node 18 for TensorFlow.js compatibility)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'  # Required for @tensorflow/tfjs-node and node-addon-api

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci  # 'npm ci' is like 'npm install' but faster for CI

      # Step 4: Build for Intel (x64)
